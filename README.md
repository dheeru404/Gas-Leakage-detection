# Gas-Leakage-detection
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is widely used for cooking fuel in developing countries
for economic reasons, for energy-rich fuel source that contains the higher calorific value,
for clean fuel with low carbon emission and for a portable that is available in even the
faraway of areas. Therefore the proposed gas leakage detection and monitoring system
for the gasoline content present in household LPG cylinder is developed. Usually, the
capacity of LPG in cylinder is not determined in an exact manner and a cylinder when
the gas is about to empty will be a difficult situation for the one who uses LPG gas for
cooking continuously. By using IoT, the information of the near to the empty level of
LPG gas in the cylinder will send to the user and the gas refill method by using
telephonic ordering can be conducted. The purpose of this research is the detection of
gas leakage and monitoring the LPG gas cylinder weight regularly to know the
remaining value of gas in the cylinder. When the gas leakage is sensed, the warning
signal and alarm sound will be active and also switch on exhaust fan automatically to
decrease the gas concentration. The weight of LPG is measured using the load sensor
(SEN-10245) and the output of the sensor is connected with Node mcu Wifi
microcontroller. The user can know the validity of LPG usage daily because the amount
of LPG gas will publish as events and watch them come through in real-time using the
Wia IoT cloud platform. Consequently, the user is alerted by giving notification to their
mobile phone when the LPG level is critically low (above 25%) by use of the integration
function of the Wia IoT platform , using its web service APIs. Then by detecting the
gas leakage with MQ2 gas sensor, this research work indicates for gas leakage condition
and also helps to prevent the LPG gas burst accidents in the home.
The project NodeMCU ESP8266 IoT based LPG Gas Leakage Alarm will be built
using MQ2 gas sensor and Blynk.
You can monitor the gas level or leakage from your smartphone. This project is easy to
build with minimum components. Lets see how we can build NodeMCU ESP8266 IoT
based LPG Gas Leakage Alarm.
There are many incidents like explosions and fire accidents due to LPG gas leakage .
Such incidents can cause dangerous effects and also affect the human lives. An IoT
based LPG leakage monitoring system will alert the people in the house if a gas leakage
will detected by the sensor, also it will send the data value to the Blynk app. So the user
can get these dataâ€™s at any time. In this project , we are using NodeMCU ESP8266 as a
controller. LPG gas sensor is connected with a microcontroller, if a sensor detects the
gas it will turn on the sensor threshold value.
# INTRODUCTION:
LPG (Liquid Petroleum Gas) is use almost in every house for cooking purpose. This gas is
highly inflammable and need to be careful while using it. There are situations where accidents
have occurred and huge damage has is done. In this article we will build a LPG gas detection
system using MQ2 Sensor. The project NodeMCU ESP8266 IoT based LPG Gas Leakage
Alarm will be built using MQ2 gas sensor and Blynk.
In this project, we are using NodeMCU ESP8266as a controller. MQ2 gas sensor is
used to detect the LPG gas.If the sensor detects the gas, it will turn on the sensor
threshold value. The sensor value will continuously uploaded to the Blynk cloud.
